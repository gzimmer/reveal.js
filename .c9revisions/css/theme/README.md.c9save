Find out how to install Sass here http://sass-lang.com/, once Sass is installed run the follwing command to start monitoring the source files for changes.\n\n```\nsass --watch css/theme/source/:css/theme --style expanded\n```\n\n\n\n## Creating a Theme\n\nTo create your own theme, start by duplicating any ```.scss``` file in [/css/theme/source](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/source). Each theme does four things in the following order:\n\n1. **Include [/css/theme/template/mixins.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/mixins.scss)**  \nShared utility functions.\n\n2. **Include [/css/theme/template/settings.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/settings.scss)**  \nDeclares a set of custom variables that the template file (step 4) expects. Can be overridden in step 3.\n\n3. **Override**  \nThis is where you override the default theme. Either by specifying variables (see [settings.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/settings.scss) for reference) or by adding full selectors with hardcoded styles.\n\n4. **Include [/css/theme/template/theme.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/theme.scss)**  \nThe template theme file which will generate final CSS output based on the currently defined variables.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1485}]],"length":1485}
